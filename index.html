                very own <strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">MECHacks - AR Edition</span></strong> hackathon is an 24-hour innovation event that gives college students a chance to flex their development muscles in a fun, collaborative environment.
                Not only do AR and VR hold tremendous promise for every industry, they also represent some of the biggest engineering challenges. During hackathon it is possible to create new products, services and execute other ideas that can eventually
                become new startups.</p>

                <li>The participating teams are solely responsible for developing/submitting their ideas.<br></li>
                <li style="color: rgb(197,197,197);"><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">The participating teams are required to bring their own extension cords.</span></strong><br></li>
                <li>Each team may consist of a maximum of 4 members. A registration fee of Rs.200 per team is mandatory to take part in the hackathon.<br></li>
                <li>Food (Dinner on the 8th of November and Breakfast on the 9th of November) and a place for resting will be provided at the event.<br></li>
                <li>Basic facilities like electricity, internet and working space will be provided to the participating teams.<br></li>
                <li>Submissions need not be complete but should be functional at the least for evaluation.<br></li>
                <li>Teams should be made up exclusively of college students who are currently pursuing<br>their undergraduate studies.<br></li>
                <li>All team members should be present at the event.<br></li>
                <li>Teams can, of course, gain advice and support from organizers, volunteers, sponsors,<br>and others.<br></li>
                <li>All work on a project should be done at the hackathon.<br></li>
                <li>Teams can use an idea they had before the event.<br></li>
                <li>Teams can work on ideas that have already been done. Hacks do not have to be “innovative”. If somebody wants to work on a common idea they should be allowed to do&nbsp;so and should be judged on the quality of their hack. These days it’s
                    hard to find something that’s fully original and teams might not know an idea has been done before anyway.<br></li>
                <li>Teams can use libraries, frameworks, or open-source code in their projects. Working on a project before the event and open-sourcing it for the sole purpose of using the code during the event is against the spirit of the rules and is not
                    allowed.<br></li>
                <li>Adding new features to existing projects is allowed. Judges will only consider new functionality introduced or new features added during the hackathon in determining the winners.<br></li>
                <li>Teams must stop hacking once the time is up.<br></li>
                <li>Teams can be disqualified from the competition at the organizers' discretion. Reasons might include but are not limited to breaking the Competition Rules or other unsporting behaviours.<br></li>
                <li>As specified in the topic, the hardware is restricted to a smartphone. Making use of any other hardware such as Google Glass or Microsoft HoloLens will not be accepted.<br></li>
